"             Measurement of parts is sometimes carried out in a workshop "
"with a single pneumatic device.\n"
"              Sometimes there may be situations where a large number of "
"measurements are required. Measuring multiple dimensions of a part "
"simultaneously will shorten the measurement time. \n"
"              Sometimes, proper positioning of the part is required to "
"ensure measurement accuracy. \n"
"              Sometimes, geometric tolerances come into play. Not only "
"diameter but also factors such as ovality, cylindricity, and taper may be "
"required. \n"
"              In such cases, probe design is important. Do not hesitate to "
"consult us, whether it is to measure a single diameter or 5 diameters.\n"
"               We have services in this regard.\n"
